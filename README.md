# Task List HTML and CSS

## Wave 1

Create a task list using static HTML.

Use semantic tags where appropriate.

Make sure your HTML validates.

## Wave 2

Style the task list using CSS.

Use no inline styles.

Add ids or classes as appropriate to help represent the role that the parts of
the HTML tags play in the page, and to help us target they with style rules.
